# AutomaticCodeGenerator
Automatic Code Creator is a tool that automates the process of generating Python code from a UML class diagram represented in XML format. The goal is to take the structural information from the UML class diagram made in app like visual-paradigm and transform it into actual Python code, including class definitions and their interdependencies. Here's how program work:

    1. Parsing XML File:  program begins by reading and parsing the XML file that contains the UML class diagram information. This XML file likely follows a specific schema or format that represents classes, attributes, methods, and relationships between classes.

    2. Extracting Class Information:  program identifies and extracts information about classes from the parsed XML. This includes class names, attributes, methods, access modifiers, and any other relevant metadata.

    3. Handling Relationships and Dependencies: program also identifies the relationships and dependencies between classes from the UML diagram. This could include associations, aggregations, compositions, inheritances, and more. It translates these relationships into appropriate Python code constructs.

    4. Writing Output Python Code: As program processes each class and its relationships, it writes the generated Python code to a Python file. The generated code should be properly formatted and organized to maintain readability.
